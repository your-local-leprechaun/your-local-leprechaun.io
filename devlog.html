                Game Update / Going Forward
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;The new game is coming along nicely! I've put in some work
                for the basic parts of the game (map creation, player movement and 
                collisions) as well as continuing to work on pixel art for it! I was
                also able to have Unity connect my controller so it will be able to 
                be used when playing this game.<br>
                In other news, I am going to try to update both the devlogs and my website
                weekly again, hopefully on Sunday. So look forward to some more updates, 
                dad jokes, and other random stuff!

                New Game Begins!
            </p>
            <img src="Pixel Art Dungeon V1.png" alt="">
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;Since it's now summer time, I decided to start work on a new
                game. My current idea is a rouge-lite (kinda like Hades) mixed with Stardew
                Valley. You'll work on growing a garden in the Hub, while exploring a dungeon
                to get seeds, materials, and other stuff. The plants you grow will be used to 
                help you grow more powerful in the game! For this game, I have two challenges.<br>
                1: Finish the game. I start things often but struggle finishing stuff. <br> 
                2: Create my own art. I am chronically bad at art for my games, so I'm
                working on creating all my own art for this game. It'll be in a 2D top-down
                pixel art style, and my first draft of it is done! It's very basic, but I'm 
                proud of what I've done!

                &emsp;&emsp;Nearing the end of our class, we're supposed to have a full
                website soon! I like where mine is, but I'd like to add some more things, 
                bother personally and as a part of my project. For this update, I added
                an improved home screen, and moved info to a new about tab! I think this
                making it better to look at over all. Along with that, I added a contact
                me to the about page! There will be lots of little changes from here on out!

            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;We've been working on how to make our websites more friendly
                for other devices, so I finally took some time and did some work on the
                mobile version of the website! Luckily, it didn't take too much finagling. 
                There are still a few things that are iffy, but over all, I'm really
                happy with it!

                Minor Changes to Website
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;Currently, we've been learning how to add in some 3D elements to our website 
                and I really liked this! Since this websites inception, I've wanted to add a shadow to the 
                header text at the top of the website and I finally have! Along with this I've added some
                box shadows on the photo in the home page as well as each card in the works page. I think
                it gives it a Si-Fi look and I like it, although it might change soon. In other news, I think
                the works page might look better with some rearranging of the elements, so look forward to that
                soon!

                Dad Joke of the Week
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;I basically went ahead of what I was supposed to do for our Milestone
                2 assignment, so for the Milestone 3 assignment, we need to add horizontal navigation
                bars...which I already have. So instead I decided to add something to the final tab.
                This used to be the about tab, which I might add in later, but I changed it to Dad Joke 
                of the Week (DJoW). I really like dad jokes and I want to share it with everyone. So
                tun in every so often, I'll try and change it regularly on Sundays!

                Works Page Creation
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;Lots of work on the website this weekend! Guess I've just been 
                a bit hyper-fixated. I created and styled the page containing all the games
                I have finished and have published on itch.io. At some point in the future, I
                want to add some of the projects I'm currently working on and create devlogs 
                for that as well.

                Website Redesign
            </p>
            <p class="main">
                &emsp;&emsp;For our assignment in Web Development, we were supposed to 
                add some style to our websites, but I think I took it a bit far.
                I added in some more colors, specifically blue and orange, but also
                a new font! I really like how it meshes with the black on dark gray
                on black of the background. A lot of work still needs to be done, for
                example an actual color pallette, but I think I've built a solid foundation so far!

                &emsp;&emsp;This marks the first day that this website is live!
                Although this is being developed as a homework assignment for web
                development class I'm taking, I hope that in the future I'll be able
                to use it as a portfolio, as well as a way to inform people about 
                my works! These devlogs will serve as the history of development, on
                both this website and other works!
